This application is use to calculate the measurement(in KB) and price of wood(currently timber).
The unit of measurement of timber is KB.
1 KB = (12feet * 3 inch * 4 inch) cubic meter.
KB of wood = (lengthbreadthheight)/144.
We divide by 144 because 12 feet = 144 inches (1 foot = 1 inches).
Price = KB* Rate of Wood.
We the length is taken in feet, breadth and height is are taken in inches and price in INR.
Could love to get some suggestion and advise on this aplication
