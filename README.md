This application is use to calculate the measurement(in KB) and price of wood(currently timber).

The unit of measurement of timber is KB.<br />
1 KB = (12feet * 3 inch * 4 inch) cubic meter.<br />
KB of wood = (lengthbreadthheight)/144.<br />
We divide by 144 because 12 feet = 144 inches (1 foot = 1 inches).<br />
Price = KB* Rate of Wood.<br />
We the length is taken in feet, breadth and height is are taken in inches and price in INR.<br />

Could love to get some suggestion and advise on this aplication
